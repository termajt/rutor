> A minimal BitTorrent client written in Rust â€” for learning and experimentation.

This is a **learning project** in Rust: a simple torrent client.

It is meant for educational purposes, to understand how the BitTorrent protocol works.

## Usage

### Using Cargo

Run the client directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo run -- <torrent-file>
```

Replace `<torrent-file>` with the path to the `.torrent` file you want to download.

### Using the built executable

After building the project, you can run the compiled binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/rutor <torrent-file>
```

This will start downloading the torrent and display a progress bar with download statistics.

### Additional help

For additional help, run with `-h/--help` flag:

```bash
cargo run -- -h
Usage: rutor [OPTIONS...] <torrent-file>

OPTIONS:
  -d/--destination    destination folder of where the torrent should be downloaded to
  -c/--consumption    shows cpu and memory consumption used by the client
  -h/--help           shows this help message and exits
```
